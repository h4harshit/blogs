Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform (From https://kafka.apache.org/intro ). To be able to understand this statement, we should be able to understand two key words here: "Streaming" & "Distributed".

Data streaming will mean that the data is generated continuously by several data sources. We can take an example of the logs being generated by several micro-services and these logs are being fed into the system which is responsible for aggregating and analyzing these logs. So, the log aggregating system will receive several streams of data from various data sources and will be responsible for processing the data.

A distributed system can be viewed as the interconnections of several heterogeneous subsystems. As in our previous example, several micro-services were writing streams of data simultaneously. So, Apache Kafka is expected to be able to receive streams of data from several data sources in parallel and to be able to process them in parallel.

The core abstraction that Kafka provides for streams of record is known as `Topic`. Producers publish data to the topics and Consumers can subscribe to a topic to read the data. We talked about multiple data sources which are publishing the data to Kafka simultaneously, so, if there is only one Topic then how can we achieve distributed processing. Each topic in Kafka can have multiple partitions and several publishers can write to these partitions simultaneously. This is how Kafka provides distributed processing while publishing the records. Please see the below diagram which is taken from the Apache Kafka's website (https://kafka.apache.org/intro)

There may be multiple subscribers/ consumers to a topic. Consumers subscribe to a topic in groups. A consumer group can have one or more consumers. If the consumer group has more than one consumers, then the record or stream from the topic will be delivered to only one consumer within that group. This is also kind of a support to the distributed processing using Apache Kafka. If there is a huge amount of data getting generated from Apache Kafka, then one consumer may not be enough to process the stream. Hence there should be multiple consumers responsible for processing the data received from Apache Kafka. Also, if the record is processed by any of the consumer then the rest of the consumers should not be processing the same record within that group. That's why consumer grouping is a very good concept to support distributed processing of data.

In the above diagram, there are two consumer groups. The first group CG-1 has only one consumer, whereas, the second group i.e.  CG-2 has three consumers. Every time a record from the topic will be distributed to only one consumer in the groups CG-1 & CG-2. If we assume that the consumers in the group CG-2 are having stateless micro-services, then we can easily visualize the distributed system in work. That is how Apache Kafka supports distributed processing and hence it is called as distributed streaming platform. So, we are back to the line 1 of this blog where we started our discussion saying that Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform and now I hope that we understand what do we mean by that.

One more important point to understand here is that, however we have said that Apache Kafka is suitable for messaging systems but the real power of Apache Kafka comes into existence when we are talking about streaming of data coming from thousands of data sources, some processing is being performed on this Input and continuous stream of data is produced in the output topic. This is the real use case of Apache Kafka. For making a one to one communication between two applications where the data volume is also not very huge, Apache Kafka is not very suitable, however you can still use Apache Kafka in this case.
