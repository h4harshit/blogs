In this article we are going to create a login screen using Flutter framework. This article does not cover the introduction or installation of Flutter.

Let's first have a look as to, what we are going to build in this article. Below is the screen from an Android mobile which will be developing.

We will design a login form with two text fields. One text field is for username and another one is for password. There will be two buttons i.e. Clear and login. Once the user presses clear button, the text entered in username and password field will be cleared. Login button will be disabled until both username and password field have values. When both the fields have values, login button will be enabled. Once you press the login button there will be an alert dialogue displayed.

The complete source code is present [here](https://gist.github.com/h4harshit/efb1eb2c1f4ffbc4e28215c7084dcdbe). Please feel free to go and check the source code.

Create a new flutter application from the command line using the following command:

```
flutter create login_screen
```

Go to the directory "login_screen", and start the flutter application, using the following command:

```
flutter run
```

Once flutter application is started, you will see the flutter demo homepage. We will replace the default application generated by flutter with a very basic application. Open the file "main.dart" and replace the code in this file with the following code:

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(new MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Login screen',
      home: MyLoginPage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyLoginPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyLoginPageState createState() => new _MyLoginPageState();
}

class _MyLoginPageState extends State<MyLoginPage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return (Scaffold(
      body: SafeArea(
        child: Center(
          child: Text(" We will make a login screen "),
        ),
      ),
    ));
  }
}
```

Once you reload the application you will see the following screen on the test device:

Now we will start creating the layout for the login page. We will be creating two text field and two buttons. Class `_MyLoginPageState` will be modified to create the layout as follows:

```
class _MyLoginPageState extends State<MyLoginPage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return (Scaffold(
      body: SafeArea(
        child: Container(
          padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 20.0),
          child: Column(
          children: <Widget>[
            SizedBox(height: 100.0,),
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: "Username",
                filled: true,
                fillColor: Colors.white12
              ),
            ),
            TextField(
              obscureText: true,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: "Password",
                filled: true,
                fillColor: Colors.white12
              ),
            ),
            ButtonBar(
              children: <Widget>[
                FlatButton(
                  child: Text("Clear"),
                  onPressed: () {

                  },
                ),
                RaisedButton(
                  child: Text("Login"),
                  onPressed: () {

                  },
                )
              ],
            )
          ],
        ),
        )
      ),
    ));
  }
}
```

Now, if you reload the application, you will see the screen similar to the following one:

Now Let's implements the "clear" button functionality. This can be easily implemented using the controller in the text field. First create controllers for username and password as shown in the following code:

```
  final _userNameController = TextEditingController();
  final _passwordController = TextEditingController();
```

Now you will need to modify the TextField for both username and password to associate the controller with them. Sample code is as below:

```
            TextField(
              controller: _userNameController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: "Username",
                  filled: true,
                  fillColor: Colors.white12),
            ),
            TextField(
              controller: _passwordController,
              obscureText: true,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: "Password",
                  filled: true,
                  fillColor: Colors.white12),
            ),
```

Now modify the "onPressed" property for the "clear" button as shown in the sample code below:

```
     onPressed: () {
        _userNameController.clear();
        _passwordController.clear();
    },
```

And that's it you should have the "clear" button fully functional now.

Now, the next step is to disable "login" button if both username and password fields do not have values. 
We will need to use a flag (Boolean field) to check whether both username and password have values or not. Let’s say this flag is ```_loginButtonDisabled```. 

A method will be invoked when the values in the username and password field is changed. This method will be responsible for setting the value for the field ```_loginButtonDisabled```, so that the login button can work appropriately.

Sample code is as below: 

```
  _checkIfTheTextBoxHasValues() {
    setState(() {
      if (_userNameController.text.trim() != "" &&
          _passwordController.text.trim() != "") {
        _loginButtonDisabled = false;
      } else {
        _loginButtonDisabled = true;
      }
    });
  }
```

Once the clear button is pressed, then like we have seen values of username field and password field will be cleared. Hence, the flag ```_loginButtonDisabled``` will be modified accordingly on the press of the “clear” button. 

We will also use an ```AlertDialog``` component, to display an alert to the user once the login button is pressed.

Sample code for the ```RaisedButton``` is as follows: 

```
                RaisedButton(
                  child: Text("Login"),
                  onPressed: _loginButtonDisabled ? null : () {
                    showDialog(
                      context: context,
                      builder: (BuildContext context){
                        return AlertDialog(
                          content: Text(" Login button was pressed."),
                          //content: Text(" Content "),
                        );
                      }
                    );
                  },
                )

```

That's it. We should have the fully functioning code as per our requirement.
